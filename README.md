> VMware Validated Design has been discontinued after VMware Validated Design 6.2 and VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2. Starting with VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3, the guidance for the SDDC components natively supported by the VMware Cloud Foundation automation has moved to the VMware Cloud Foundation documentation and the guidance for the solutions on top of VMware Cloud Foundation is now published under a new class of technical reference implementations called VMware Validated Solutions. For full information on VMware Validated Solutions visit [vmware.com/go/vvs](https://vmware.com/go/vvs).

# VMware Validated Design 6.2.0

With each release of the VMware Validated Designs, the Solutions Architecture team creates or updates the Design Decisions provided in the Architecture and Design sections of the documentation. 

It's our pleasure to share the Design Decisions from VMware Validated Design 6.2.0 release in Microsoft Excel format with the community. 

If you have deployed or plan to deploy the VMware Validated Design, you can use these Design Decisions to ensure compliance with the design.

The set includes:

* Standard Architecture
    * Management Domain (Dual-Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Workload Domain - Virtual Infrastructure (Dual-Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Tanzu Workload Domain (Single-Region)
    * Cloud Operations and Automation (Dual-Region and Multi-AZ).
